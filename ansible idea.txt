Ansible Idea:

Ansible Playbook pulling backups from all important devices and commiting to git repo for change control and no file pollution

package into script/shell command and attach to windows task scheduler on server
	open WSL
		run from directory
maybe define tasks with python

  hosts: n9k

  tasks:
    - name: get nxos facts via ssh

      local_action: copy content={{ ansible_net_config }} dest={{ local_git_repo_path }}/{{ ansible_net_hostname }}.txt

- name: COMMIT CONFIGURATION CHANGES TO GIT
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  tags: git

  tasks:
    - name: remove commented lines with timestamps
      # Cisco/NXOS specific - avoid timestamp from always marking config as changed
      shell: |
        sed -i -e '/^!Time/d' {{ local_git_repo_path }}/*.txt
      args:
        warn: no

    - name: commit changes to git
      shell: |
        git add .
        git commit -m "Config snapshot taken $(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")"
        # Needed as git commit will fail if there are no changed files
        exit 0
      args:
        chdir: "{{ local_git_repo_path }}"
